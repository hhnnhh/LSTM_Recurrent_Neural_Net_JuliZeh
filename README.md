A KERAS Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) trained on parts of the book "Spieltrieb" by Juli Zeh

## Idea: 
Juli Zeh is my favorite German writer and love the idea to be able to generate text that she should have come up with. Therefore I decided built a Juli-Zeh-Text-Robot, based on text she has written. To begin with, I chose one of her earlier books, “Spieltrieb”, published in 2004.
The model is a Recurrent Neural Network, a type of networks which can handle sequential data such as text. 

The language model predicts the probability of the next word in a sentence based on the words the model observed or was trained on. 

## Data: 
According to the Keras developers, the training data set should at least have ~100k characters, but ~1M is better. I chose the book “Spieltrieb” by Juli Zeh and copied a text file of ~180k characters from it, while randomizing chapters. (By randomizing, I hoped to prevent copyright issues when publishing the data, so nobody would be able to steal the book to read it.)

<!---##Getting started: 
First thing was loading the packages, which was awkwardly the biggest problem I encountered when training the NN. After some days of having system shut downs every few minutes I finally decided to deinstall Anaconda and install Miniconda, cleaning the system, reinstalling the IDE (PyCharm) – which was the best decision, because afterwards everything was finally working fine.

## Data Preprocessing:
1.	First, the text was imported, read and transformed into lowercase, resulting in ~500k characters, including spaces
```python
with io.open(path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read().lower()
 print('corpus length:', len(text))
#corpus length: 521650
```
In the next step, the chars are sorted, listed, counted and enumerated. 

```python
chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
print('total chars:', len(chars))
#total chars: 70
#enumerating the symbols
char_indices = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
# \n:0, ' ':1, '!':2..'
indices_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
# 0:\n..
```
<!---Chars are: 
['\n', ' ', '!', '+', ',', '-', '.', '/', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '9', ':', ';', '=', '?', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'ß', 'à', 'ä', 'é', 'ë', 'ñ', 'ó', 'ö', 'ü', 'ą', 'ć', 'ę', 'ł', 'ń', 'ś', 'š', 'ż', '–', '’', '…', '‹', '›', '\ufeff']
Apparently U+FEFF is a byte order mark, or ‘BOM’, i.e. an encoding specification for UTF formats. It could also be removed, but I decided to ignore it.
